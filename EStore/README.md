# General Problem:
The general problem that is solved with this program is adding inventory to an electronic store and categorically searching for items based on user input (if any).

## Assumptions:
It assumes that the user has the necessary information to add the item to the store's inventory.

## Limitations:
The limitations to this solution is that the an item wont be added if it doesn't have an ID code, year and name. If a value is missing in the required values for any item, the user will have to wait until all item  value prompts are completed to know that one of those values is required.  The keyWord matching only works up to 4 words in the title, this will be improved in further editions.
