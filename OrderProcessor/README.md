# OrderProcessor Assignment
## Project: Generic Container Design

## Project Overview
Design a generic container called GenericOrder that acts as a collection of an arbitrary number of objects in Products.java

## Description
### Part 1
- Design a mechanism that gives each instance of the container a unique identifier. Implement as many methods as necessary. You must use Java generics features. 
- Design and implement a subclass of GenericOrder called ComputerOrder that takes an arbitrary number of different classes of ComputerPart objects, Peripheral objects, and Service objects. Implement as many methods as necessary. 
- Design and implement a subclass of GenericOrder called PartyTrayOrder that takes an arbitrary number of different classes of Cheese objects, Fruit objects, and Service objects. Implement as many methods as necessary. 
- Create a client class to test OrderProcessor. You will need to create a datagenerator for testing purpose. It is not mandatory but you may use a variation of Data Generator in TiJ pages 637 to 638. 

### Part 2
- Design and implement a subclass of GenericOrder called ComputerPartyOrder that takes an arbitrary number of different classes of ComputerPart objects, Peripheral objects, Cheese objects, Fruit objects and Service objects. 
- Create another client class that creates ComputerPartyOrder. 
- Modify OrderProcessor if necessary.
